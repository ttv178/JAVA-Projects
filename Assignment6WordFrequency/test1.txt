Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica in 1769. 
His family had received French nobility status when 
France made Corsica a province in that year, 
and Napoleon was sent to France in 1777 to 
study at the Royal Military School in Brienne. 
In 1784, Napoleon spent a year studying at the Ecole Militaire in Paris,
 graduating as a Second Lieutenant of artillery. 
Sent to Valence on a peacetime mission, 
Napoleon whiled away the hours there educating himself in history and geography. 
During the tumultuous years of the French Revolution, 
Napoleon fought well for the Republic, helping to defeat the British at Toulon. 
For his services there, he was made a Brigadier General. 
After the Directory came to power, Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais
and gained command of the French army in Italy, where, 
after defeating the Austrians in 1797, he negotiated the Treaty of Campo Formio. 
This victory boosted Napoleon to widespread popularity when he returned to France. 
Eager to get rid of this potential challenger,
the Directory agreed to let Napoleon take an army on an Egyptian campaign to capture 
Egypt and hamper British shipping to India. 
Napoleon's campaign in Egypt did not go as planned, 
and when he heard that the Directory was losing power,
 he abandoned his army 
and rapidly returned to Paris to take advantage of the situation,
becoming the first of three consuls in the new government proclaimed in 1799
